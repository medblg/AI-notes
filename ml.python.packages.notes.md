https://www.upgrad.com/blog/top-python-libraries-for-machine-learning/


# numpy
- general-purpose array-processing package
- powerful to process large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices

# SciPy

- modules in science and analytics :
linear algebra, image optimization, integration interpolation, special functions, Fast Fourier transform, signal and image processing

- SciPy depends on NumPy for the array manipulation subroutines

# Scikit-learn

- built on top of NumPy and SciPy
- developing machine learning algorithms
- supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
- main ml that can be handled ->
  - classification
  - regression
  - clustering
  - dimensionality reduction
  - model selection
  - preprocessing

# TensorFlow

- by google
- framework for creating ML models
- stable Python and C++ APIs


# Keras

- used for neural network and machine learning
- has features to work with:
  - images, text images..


# pandas

- used for data analysis
- work on relational or labeled data.
- main 2 types of data structures used :
  1. Series (1-dimensional)
  2. DataFrame (2-dimensional)

# matplotlib

- is a data visualization library used for 2D plotting.
- helps generate histograms, plots, error charts, scatter plots..
- matlab-like interface
